This is the frontend part of the tallink test work.

To start frontend server you are required to have node js installed to your computer.

First you have to download the modules. To do that open your terminal and move to frontend directory.

1) Insert to terminal npm install or yarn install.
2) yarn start or npm start.
3) Server should be running now on port 3000

For testing you are required to have jasmine. To install jasmine you must write to terminal npm install jasmine -g. Then cd to frontend test folder and write jasmine [testname].
